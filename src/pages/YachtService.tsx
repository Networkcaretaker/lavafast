          We know that first impressions are important particularly when the owners or their guests are on board.  At Lavafast Laundry Service we make sure that we help you every step of the way to ensuring that your linen is returned clean and crisp and that your towels are returned fluffed and folded.

 

We check all linen for stains before entering our machines and spot treat any stains with the best products available on the market, taking care not to damage any fibres in the process. Pillow cases are ironed and packed flat to avoid any creases and we do not iron any fold creases in any linen. All linen is hand-finished to ensure that it is delivered like new.
